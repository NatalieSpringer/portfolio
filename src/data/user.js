			`I'm a versatile full-stack mobile app developer with a wealth of experience. My skill set includes working with React Native, native iOS Development, watchOS development, AWS Lambdas, and more. Before diving into mobile app development, I used to explore the world of offensive security testing. When I'm not immersed in coding, I love indulging in my hobbies of reading, travelling, and enjoying a good game of chess or playing the guitar. Feel free to reach out and let's create something amazing together!`,
